                    <p className='text-white'>In 2012, lithium consumption in the United States was estimated to be about 2,000 metric tons (t) of contained lithium, the same as that in 2011 and about 80% greater than that in 2010. The increase in U.S. consumption in 2011 and 2012 relative to 2010 was primarily the result of increased demand for lithium- based air treatment, battery, ceramic and glass, grease, metallurgical, pharmaceutical, and polymer products in the United States. Net imports of lithium compounds into the United States in 2012 decreased by about 5% from those in 2011, and were nearly 15% lower than those in 2008. In the United States, one lithium brine operation with associated lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide plants operated in Silver Peak, NV. Domestic and imported lithium carbonate, lithium chloride, and lithium hydroxide were consumed directly in industrial applications and used as raw materials for downstream lithium compounds. Argentina and Chile were the principal sources of imported lithium carbonate, lithium chloride, and lithium hydroxide. World lithium production in 2012 (excluding U.S. production) was estimated to be 36,600t of lithium contained in minerals and compounds, an increase of 8% from that of 2011.</p>

                    <p className='text-white'>Lithium historically has been mined from two distinct sources: continental brines and hard rock minerals. Chile, the world's leading producer of lithium carbonate, recovered lithium from two brine operations on the Salar de Atacama in the Andes. Concentrated brines were transported to and processed at two lithium carbonate plants, one lithium chloride plant, and one lithium hydroxide plant in Antofagasta, on the Chilean coast. Lithium carbonate and lithium chloride also were produced from brines from the Salar del Hombre Muerto in the Andes Mountains in Argentina. A large percentage of the lithium carbonate produced in South America was exported to the United States. In China, lithium carbonate was produced from brines from the Zabayu Salt Lake in western Tibet and from the Dongtai and Xitai Salt Lakes in Qinghai Province. China was the only country that produced large quantities of lithium carbonate from mineral concentrates, mostly from imported Australian spodumene. Australia was, by far, the leading producer of lithium mineral concentrates, but Brazil, China, Portugal, and Zimbabwe also produced significant quantities, most of which is used directly in the production of ceramics and glass.</p>
                    <p className='text-headerMobile md:text-header font-semibold mt-5 mb-3 text-white'>CONSUMPTION</p>
                    <p className='text-white'>Lithium is sold as brines, compounds, metal, or mineral concentrates depending on the end use. Lithium's electrochemical reactivity and other unique properties have resulted in many commercial lithium products. For many years, most lithium compounds and minerals were used in the production of ceramics, glass, and primary aluminum. As a result of growth in lithium battery use and a reduction in the use of lithium in aluminum production, batteries have gained market share. For 2012, according to one estimate, the main global markets for lithium products were batteries, 35%; ceramics and glass, 26%; lubricating greases, 13%; metallurgy, 8%; air conditioning, 4%; polymers, 3%; medical applications, 3%; and other uses, 8%* (Desormeaux, 2013, p. 13). Other uses may have included alloys, cement and concrete, dyestuffs, industrial bleaching and sanitation, pool chemicals, and specialty inorganics (FMC Corp., 2008).</p>

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>The Portable Rechargeable Battery Association reported that the number of lithium-ion cells produced worldwide increased to 4.4 billion in 2012, a 450% increase from 800 million cells made in 2002 (Seetharaman, 2013). The global lithium-ion battery market had revenues of $11.7 billion in 2012. Consumer applications (cameras, cellular telephones, computer tablets, laptop computers, etc.) accounted for 64% of the revenues; industrial applications (aerospace and defense, energy storage, industrial tools, medical devices, etc.) accounted for 22%; and automotive applications (EVs, HEVs, PHEVs, and electric bicycles) accounted for 14%. Although the consumer segment accounted for the highest revenues in 2012, the industrial and automotive segments increased at a faster pace. The greatest share of consumer and industrial revenues came from North America, and China led in automotive revenues. (Tohani, 2013).</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Increased use of larger lithium-ion batteries can be attributed in part to the rapid replacement of nickel-cadmium batteries with lithium-ion batteries in heavy-duty power tools. According to Robert Bosch GmbH, a leading manufacturer of power tools, 74% of new cordless power tools produced in 2012 were powered by lithium-ion batteries, up from only 26% in 2007 (MÃ¼ller, 2013).</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>In 2012, China, Japan, and the Republic of Korea accounted for 85% to 90% of global lithium-ion battery production. Germany, Switzerland, and the United States were among other countries producing lithium-ion batteries (Tohani, 2013). According to a Japanese market research firm, the Republic of Korea overtook Japan (the leading lithium-ion battery producer since 1991) in 2011 to become the leading manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries (Sung-Mi, 2012).</p>

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>In 2011, Alcoa Inc. developed a third- generation aluminum- lithium alloy that could contribute to lighter, less costly, and more corrosion resistant airplanes compared with those using composite alternatives. The alloy reduced density by up to 7% in critical structural components. In May, as part of a plan to expand its aluminum lithium production capacity and capabilities, Alcoa began construction of a new $90 million facility adjacent to its Lafayette, IN, plant with a capacity to produce more than 20,000 t/yr of aluminum lithium. Alcoa also began expanding aluminum lithium capacity at its Technical Center in Alcoa Center, PA, and Alcoa's Kitts Green plant in the United Kingdom (Chai, 2011; Alcoa Inc., 2013, p. 17).</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Addition of lithium carbonate to aluminum potlines lowers the melting point of the cryolite bath, allows a lower operating temperature for the cells, increases the electrical conductivity, and decreases bath viscosity.

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Worldwide production and consumption of lithium increased in 2012. Two major lithium producing countries, Chile and Australia, increased lithium production by 9% and 8%, respectively, from that of 2011. World lithium production in 2012 (excluding U.S. production) was estimated to be 36,600t of lithium contained in minerals and compounds, an increase of 8% from that of 2011.</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Lithium end-use markets for batteries, ceramics and glass, grease, and other industrial applications all increased. World lithium consumption was estimated by Roskill Information Services (2013a) to be 28,200t of lithium contained in minerals and compounds in 2012, an increase of approximately 9% from Roskill's consumption estimate of 2011. Capacity utilization among the current lithium producers was estimated to be greater than 80%.</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Total lithium consumption growth averaged 6.4% per year from 2000 through 2012. Based on estimated total lithium consumption and an estimated lithium chemical market share of total consumption of about 75%, an estimated 21,200 t of lithium was consumed in chemicals and the remainder as mineral concentrates used in the ceramics and glass industry in 2012.</p>

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>World lithium consumption forecasts to 2015 and 2020 were projected by numerous lithium producers and many leading lithium market analysts. On average, their conclusions indicated that world lithium consumption was likely to increase to approximately 190,000 t/yr of LCE by 2015 and to 280,000 t/yr of LCE by 2020 (Clarke, 2012a). From 2012 to 2017, average annual growth in world lithium consumption was expected to be approximately 11% (Baylis, 2013, p. 23). New lithium producers were expected to supply approximately 25% of the lithium required by 2020 (Baylis and Chegwidden, 2012, p. 29).</p>

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Annual growth in lithium consumed globally for batteries averaged 21% per year between 2000 and 2012. Demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries continues to have the greatest potential for growth. The lithium-ion battery market was expected to increase by 200% by 2017, the equivalent of an additional 90,000 t of LCE (Baylis, 2013, p. 26). The global market for lithium-ion batteries was forecast to reach $9 billion by 2015, with potential to exceed $50 billion by 2020 (Schrader, 2012). Other lithium end uses were projected to increase also, but at lower rates than batteries.</p>

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Most global automobile manufacturers have announced plans to use lithium-ion batteries in current or future generations of EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs. Vehicles with lithium-ion batteries from companies such as Bavarian Motor Works AG (BMW); Ford Motor Co.; General Motors Co.; Honda Motor Co., Ltd.; Hyundai Group; Tesla Motors, Inc. Toyota Motor Corp.; and Volkswagen Group were introduced in 2012. Major automobile manufacturers formed partnerships with established battery manufacturers to build battery plants for hybrid and electric-vehicles and begin mass production of lithium-ion batteries.</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>The worldwide market for lithium-ion batteries used in light duty vehicles was forecast to increase to approximately $22 billion by 2020 from $1.6 billion in 2012. As manufacturing efficiencies improve, the cost of lithium- ion batteries was expected to decrease by more than one-third by 2017 (Pike Research, 2012; Navigant Research, 2013).</p>
                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>The successful use of lithium-ion batteries in EVs, HEVs, and PHEVs could greatly increase consumption of lithium. If the rate of consumption increases faster than supply, prices could increase, and spodumene and other lithium resources that had been considered uneconomic might once again yield economically feasible raw materials for the production of lithium carbonate. New lithium mineral operations under development throughout the world specifically designed to produce battery-grade lithium carbonate demonstrate the potential economic viability of these mineral operations.</p>

                    <p className='mb-3 text-white'>Various countries worldwide were establishing national alternative energy policies that have the potential to substantially increase lithium demand. It was anticipated that Asia, North America, and Western Europe would be at the forefront of adopting utility-scale energy storage systems that would become integral components of electricity grids in the future, for long-duration storage as well as short-duration ancillary services. China, in particular, was expected to become the largest utility-scale energy storage market in the world, with $586 billion in Government funds to be invested by 2020.</p>

Of several energy storage technologies competing within the short-duration ancillary services market, advanced lithium-ion batteries were expected to hold the greatest potential, capturing approximately 70% of the ancillary services market worldwide by 2019. Worldwide revenue from sales of lithium-ion batteries for use in utility-scale energy storage systems was expected to increase to nearly $6 billion in 2020, from $72 million in 2012 (Pike Research, 2010; Oyama, 2011).</p>
